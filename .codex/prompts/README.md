# Codex Prompts

Store shared Codex prompt templates here. The root `.gitignore` keeps the rest
of the Codex CLI runtime state out of git while retaining this folder so the
toolkit can rely on `CODEX_HOME` existing.

Bundled starters:
- `analysis.md` — structure discovery work before anyone starts coding.
- `handoff.md` — capture progress and next steps when another agent takes over.
