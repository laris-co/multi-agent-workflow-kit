# Define each agent's branch and worktree location here.
# Copy this file to match your team structure; run `.agents/setup.sh` afterward.
#
# Agent naming is flexible - use any pattern that works for your workflow:
#   - Simplified: 1, 2, 3 (recommended for quick setup)
#   - Descriptive: backend-api, frontend-ui, data-processor
#   - Legacy: 1-agent, 2-agent, 3-agent (still supported)
